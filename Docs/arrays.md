# Arrays in Golang 

Arrays are useful when planning the detailed layout of memory and sometimes can help avoid allocation, but primarily they are a building block for slices, the subject of the next section. To lay the foundation for that topic, here are a few words about arrays. 

There are major differences between the ways arrays work in Go and C. In Go,

* Arrays are values. Assigning one array to another copies all the elements.
* In particular, if you pass an array to a function, it will receive a copy of the array, not a pointer to it.
* The size of an array is part of its type. The types [10]int and [20]int are distinct.

The value property can be useful but also expensive; if you want C-like behavior and efficiency, you can pass a pointer to the array. 

```go
func Sum(a *[3]float64) (sum float64) {
    for _, v := range *a {
        sum += v
    }
    return
}

array := [...]float64{7.0, 8.5, 9.1}
x := Sum(&array)  // Note the explicit address-of operator
```
But even this style isn't idiomatic Go. Use slices instead.
