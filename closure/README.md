# Closures in Go 

A Closure is a function bundled together with its referencing environment.

It captures variables from its outer scope, allowing those variables to be accessed and used within the closure.
This enables the closure to maintain it's own state and retain access to the captured variables even after the outer function has finished execution.

## Benefits and Use Cases 

1. Encapsulating private state: Closures allow for the creation of functions with private varibles that are inaccessbles from outside the closure. This helps in building modular and secure code.

2. Function factories : Closures can act as factories for generating specialized functions based on specific configurations or parameters.They allow for the creations of custom function with pre-set behaviors.

3. Maintaining State across multiple calls : Closures enable functions to retain state across successive invocations.The captured variables within closures store their values, allowing functions to remember and update their state as needed.

4. Callbacks and event handlers : Closures are commonly used for implementing callbacks and event handlers.They captures variables and provide a mechanism for executing specific actions when events occurs.

5. Asyncrhonus operations : Closures are useful when dealing with asynchronous operations or goroutines.They help in passing data and behavior into goroutins, ensuring that each goroutine operates with its own set of capture variables.
